# sirius-playlister
An angular 2 port and rewrite based off of ["sirius-playlists"](https://github.com/alaycock/sirius-playlists) by [alaycock](https://github.com/alaycock). üéâ

To get up and going you will need typescript and npm installed

1. Clone the repo:
> git clone https://github.com/webdevbrian/sirius-playlister.git

2. Install npm packages:
> npm Install

3. Start the server which runs browsersync (auto refresh) and the gulp asset watcher for development
> npm Start

4. Eat cake.

***

## Plans for this currently include (and are subject to change at any time):

‚úì Start new repository from the ground up for a full rewrite

‚úì Boilerplate for Gulp / Angular 2 / npm with browsersync for dev and production building & SASS / Typescript

‚òê Bootstrap 4

‚òê First version of a UI

‚òê Might migrate away from MongoDB and go to couchDB

‚òê API based backend to form requests for the data we fetch from the sirius JSON

‚òê Dashboard like view for statistics for played songs, etc (D3 charts, etc)

‚òê Ability to export songs to Spotify / automatically inject favorite channels into playlists in your spotify account that automatically prunes / grows by itself

‚òê Localstorage for settings / configuration options
