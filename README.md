# sirius-playlister
An angular 2 port and rewrite based off of ["sirius-playlists"](https://github.com/alaycock/sirius-playlists) by [alaycock](https://github.com/alaycock). 🎉

## Plans for this currently include (and are subject to change at any time):

✓ Start new repository from the ground up for a full rewrite

☐ Angular 2

☐ Bootstrap 4

☐ Might migrate away from MongoDB and go to couchDB

☐ API based backend to form requests for the data we fetch from the sirius JSON

☐ Dashboard like view for statistics for played songs, etc (D3 charts, etc)

☐ Ability to export songs to Spotify / automatically inject favorite channels into playlists in your spotify account that automatically prunes / grows by itself

☐ Localstorage for settings / configuration options
